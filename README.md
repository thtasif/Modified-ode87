# Modified-ode87

In this project the Nonlinear Pendulum Problem has been solved using ode87 integrator from file exchange and using a modified version of the integrator.
The version of the ode87 function I got in file exchange is not capable of evaluating number of steps, number of failed steps and number of function evaluations 
in a integration. But using the modified ode87 function, it is possible to get those information.
